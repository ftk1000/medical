    PROMPT: Does apple watch monitor breathing regularity?

# Breathing regularity

Here’s how you can check **breathing regularity** with your Apple Watch and the Health app. It depends on whether you mean **respiratory rate tracking** (basic, available on most models) or the new **Breathing Disturbances / sleep apnea notifications** (available only on newer models).

---

## 1. **Respiratory Rate (Breaths Per Minute)**

This feature is available on **Apple Watch Series 3 or later**.

**On Apple Watch:**

* Make sure you’ve set up **Sleep Tracking** in the **Sleep app**.
* Wear your watch to bed.
* In the morning, open the **Sleep app** on your Watch → scroll down to see your **Respiratory Rate** (average breaths per minute during sleep).

**On iPhone (Health app):**

* Open the **Health app**.
* Tap **Browse** → **Respiratory** → **Respiratory Rate**.
* You’ll see nightly averages, trends, and ranges over days, weeks, and months.

⚠️ Note: This is just an *average breathing rate*, not detailed regularity (like pauses or irregular patterns).

---

## 2. **Breathing Disturbances (Sleep Apnea Notifications)**

Available on **Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2** with **watchOS 11 / iOS 18**.

**Setup:**

1. On iPhone, go to **Health app** → **Browse** → **Respiratory** → **Breathing Disturbances**.
2. Turn on **Sleep Apnea Notifications** (you may need to enable **Wrist Detection** and **Sleep Tracking**).
3. Wear your Apple Watch during sleep **for at least 10 nights in a 30-day window**.

**Check Results:**

* In **Health app** → **Breathing Disturbances**, you’ll see:

  * **Nightly status**: “Elevated” vs. “Not Elevated”.
  * **Trends** over 1, 6, or 12 months.
  * A **PDF report** you can export and share with your doctor.

⚠️ If your results show *consistent “Elevated” nights (50% or more in 30 days)*, Apple Watch will notify you that you may have **possible moderate to severe sleep apnea**.

---

## 3. **Mindful Session (Optional Check)**

If you want to spot-check your breathing while awake:

* Open the **Mindfulness app** on your Watch.
* Start a **Breathe session**.
* The Watch tracks your guided breathing, but this is *for relaxation*, not for diagnosing irregularity.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* For a quick view: Check **Respiratory Rate in the Sleep app** (nightly average).
* For sleep apnea screening: Use **Breathing Disturbances in Health app** (only on Series 9/10/Ultra 2).
* For daytime awareness: Use **Mindfulness → Breathe** (manual session, not continuous monitoring).
