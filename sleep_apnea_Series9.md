# does Apple Watch Series 9 support breathing disturbance measurements?



Yes — **Apple Watch Series 9** does support **Breathing Disturbance** measurements, which form the basis of the **Sleep Apnea Notifications** feature.

---

### What the Feature Does

* The Series 9 (as well as Series 10 and Ultra 2) can use its **accelerometer** to detect subtle wrist movements during sleep that signal interruptions in regular breathing patterns, referred to as **“Breathing Disturbances.”**
  ([Apple Support][1], [Apple][2])

* Each night, your watch classifies your breathing disturbances as either **“Elevated”** or **“Not Elevated.”**
  ([Apple Support][1])

* If over a 30-day window (with at least 10 tracked sleep nights) **50% or more nights** are tagged as “Elevated,” the Health app will notify you that you may be showing signs of **moderate to severe sleep apnea** — giving you the option to view/export a PDF report for your doctor.

### Model Support Confirmation

* Apple explicitly states that the **Sleep Apnea Notifications feature is available on Apple Watch Series 9 or later and Apple Watch Ultra 2** (excluding Apple Watch SE models) when running the latest watchOS version.
  ([Apple][2], [Apple Support][1])

---

### FDA Clearance & Validation

* The feature has received **FDA approval** for the Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2, marking it as a clinically backed screening tool—not a diagnostic device.
  ([Axios][3], [Investopedia][4])

---

### Real-World Confirmation

* Media reports (e.g., ABC7) confirm the rollout: *“Apple's new sleep apnea detection feature will be available in the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2.”*
  ([ABC7 Los Angeles][5])

* Apple has announced availability in many regions such as Australia and beyond.

   ([Apple Support][8], [Intego][9])

2. Ensure you **wear your watch to sleep regularly**, meeting at least **10 nights within a 30-day period** to allow the system to analyze data.
   ([Apple Support][1], [Apple][2])

3. Over time, check your Health app for the “Elevated” vs. “Not Elevated” trends and any notifications — plus export a PDF if needed for your healthcare provider.
